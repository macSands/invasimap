Title: Quantifying Invasion Fitness â€” a trait-based, site-specific workflow
Description: Provides a trait-based, site-specific workflow to quantify invasion fitness by combining predicted abundances, trait-based competition, and environmental matching. Includes tools to simulate invaders, compute interaction kernels, assemble impact tensors, and visualise trait dispersion.
